# ACM_Hackathon

Basically we are creating an app where a farmer will have their location registered, which crops they are growing and then using location we can find current atmospheric condition. Based on all of this data, we will give the recommended amount of water to give to crops  Give me the workflow on how to create/find the soil and crop data needed and then how we will integrate that into finding the ultimate recommended water amount needed
